-- Emergency production containment for the PBK Data API.
--
-- PBK's browser clients use the authenticated Render bridge. They do not
-- query Supabase directly, so public-schema objects must fail closed for the
-- anon and authenticated API roles. RLS without policies is intentionally
-- used as the default-deny posture.
